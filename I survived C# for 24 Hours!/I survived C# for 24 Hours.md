# I Survived 24 Hours Learning C#  

Welcome back to **Logan's Logical Lab!** 🚀 In this video, I take on a **24-hour challenge** to learn **C#**, a powerful programming language developed by Microsoft.  

## 🔍 What is C#?  
C# is part of the **C family** (C, C++, C#) and is widely used in software development, including .NET applications. Unlike Python and HTML/CSS (which I already know), **C# is a compiled language**, meaning it requires compilation before running.  

## 🎯 The Challenge Rules  
- The challenge started **when I woke up on February 8th** at 8:20 AM.  
- I followed a **4-hour Bro Code tutorial** on C# as my main resource.  
- I worked on **two projects**:  
  - **A simple calculator** (runs in the terminal).  
  - **A to-do list app** (very basic, no save functionality).  

## ⏳ The Learning Journey  
- **First Break:** Around **10:04 AM**, after an hour of watching the tutorial.  
- **Midday Progress:** Built a **basic calculator program** (~1 hour 18 minutes into the tutorial).  
- **Afternoon Struggles:** Took a break at **2 PM**, watched a YouTuber’s video on learning C# in a week.  
- **Evening Project:** Started working on **a UI-based to-do list app**, though it lacked proper functionality.  

## 💡 Key Takeaways  
- C# **compiles before running**, which helped catch errors early.  
- Compared to Python, **debugging was different**—C# gives errors upfront, whereas Python often crashes mid-script.  
- I discovered that **UI development** in C# isn’t as simple as I expected.  

## 🔮 What’s Next?  
- I built **a number guessing game** after the challenge.  
- Another **"I Survived" video** is coming soon—**the programming language has a "V" in its name**! Any guesses? 👀
